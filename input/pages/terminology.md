Evaluation depends on coded information. Data elements such as substances, dose forms, and routes of administration must be coded, using the same code system in the queries and the knowledge base of the guidelines. Units for strength and dosage must also be standardized.

* Substances
* Dose forms
* Units of measure (for specification of strength)

Several code systems can be supported at the same time.

Properties and capabilities of the terminology determine how the guidelines can be defined. When using a flat code system, all substances have to be listed in the ValueSets. A hierarchical code system like SNOMED CT would potentially allow for higher-level definitions in the ValueSets (intensional definition), which are then expanded using the hierarchy of the code system.
