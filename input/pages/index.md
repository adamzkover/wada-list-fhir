### Background

**WADA**, the World Anti Doping Agency publishes **guidelines** on the use of medicines: "The List of Prohibited Substances and Methods (List) indicates **what substances and methods are prohibited in sport and when**."

The guidelines are published as human-readable text on the websites of WADA and its affiliated national organizations.

**Our research question is:** Can the **guidelines be updated**, using the terminology from ["A multilayered framework for representing clinical decisions"]( https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article/18/Supplement_1/i132/797073), from Unstructured **to Executable**, using HL7 standards such as **FHIR and CQL**?

An example of such a computable guideline representation is the [WHO Antenatal Care Guideline Implementation Guide](https://build.fhir.org/ig/WorldHealthOrganization/smart-anc/index.html).

Benefits of a computable guideline representation include the ability to evaluate new products automatically, and the possibility to build clinical decision support services on the knowledge base represented by the gudeline's resources.

See the [Implementation](implementation.html) page for technical details of the implementation.
