This is a proof of concept implementation of the WADA List of Prohibited Substances and Methods as computable knowledge representation, using the HL7 standards [CQL](https://cql.hl7.org/) and [FHIR (R4)](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/).

The implementation is limited to a subset of the List, and uses substance codes defined in the Norwegian Electronic Prescription Support System (FEST) from the Norwegian Medical Products Agency (NOMA).

This content is developed as an exam submission for the course IT, Organization and Cooperation in Healthcare (IT6103) at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). Its sole purpose is to demonstrate the feasibility of the technological solution and should not be used to inform any real-life decisions.

See the [Artifact Summary](artifacts.html) for an overview of the resources that define the knowledge base and the clinical logic.
